# common-build-scripts
Common build scripts to use for repos employing the IAM docker/python/poetry stack. 

It's silly to re-define these every time; this will help promote cohesion
and reduce maintenance as needs change.


## Repository Structure

```
- README.md  # This document, thanks for reading me!
+ scripts    # Things you run (e.g., `./scripts/script-name.sh`)
+ sources    # Things you source (e.g., `source ./sources/collection-name.sh`)
```
